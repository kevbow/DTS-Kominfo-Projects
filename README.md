# Tic-tac-toe
This is a task from when I took DTS Kominfo Online Academy program. The task is to make a simple tic-tac-toe gameboard with player vs computer. The first move always taken by the computer and place in cell (1, 1). The board is 3x3 with cell name 0, 1, 2 for either row and column. The computer move is generated with random number.
